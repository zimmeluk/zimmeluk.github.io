    			<h2>January 4, 2018: Civitavecchia</h2>

    			<h4>Airporti de Roma</h4>

    			<p>After arriving in Rome at 7:10 AM at Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, we went through customs and retreived our bags. Two members of the group flew separately to Munich, Germany and were delayed five hours, but met us later that night. The temperature outisde was a humid 57 degrees, much warmer than the -5 degrees when we left Minneapolis.</p>

    			<p>We met our guide for the trip, Michaela, at the airport. Michaela was born in Scicily and moved to Rome in 1989. She has a 17-year-old daughter and has since moved our toward the coast near Rome due to the high cost of living. From ADR (Airporti de Roma), Michaela escorted us to our tour bus to meet Marco, our bus driver, and head north to Civitavecchia.</p>

    			<p>The drive to Civitavecchia took about an hour, but it seemed to go much faster. The highway had four total lanes, and traffic was generally light. However, the roads were much smaller that the United States. The most popular car manufacturers are Peugeot, Fiat, Opel, and Citroen, but it is also not uncommon to see vehicles from Mercedes-Benz, Land Rover, and Toyota on the road. While Ford, Chevrolet, and Chrystler are also represented, the cars are much smaller than what is found in the U.S. Other first impressions included an incredibly green countryside.</p>

    			<h4>Civitavecchia</h4>
    			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civitavecchia">Civitavecchia</a> is a port town on the Tyrrhenian Sea of 53,000 people, roughly 50 miles northwest of Rome. The modern-day Civitavecchia (meaning "Ancient Town") was built over an old Etruscan settelement. However, few buildings or remenants of the ancient civilization remain in the town itself. The Taurine Baths of Trajan from ancient Rome lie 5km northeast of the city.</p>

    			<p>Once we arrived in Civitavecchia, we checked into Hotel San Giorgio around 9:45 AM. This 4-star hotel was located on the beach and was our home base as we planned to explore Etruscan territory over the next couple of days. After checking in, we went on a walking tour of the city and got a feel for what a typical Italian town.</p>

        		<p>There is nothing particularly special about Civitavecchia itself. As the port of Rome, there were many barges and cruise ships visible off the coast and in the harbor. The town was heavily bombed during WWII since it was a port town, which is evident by the remaining ruins of some buildings. North of the town is Terme Taurine, or the Baths of Trajan, which the group did not visit. The main attraction, however, is right on the shoreline. Fort Michelangelo was a 16th century fortress that has since been turned into a monument. Tourists can walk all the way around the fort and receive panoramic pictures of the shoreline.</p>
