        		<h2>January 5, 2018: Travel</h2>

        		<h4>Minneapolis to Newark</h4>

    			<p>The first day of the trip was dedicated solely to traveling. The group departed MSP at 11:20 AM (CST) on an Embracer ERJ 170 flying for United Airlines. We arrived at Newark at 3:11 PM (EST). The New York skyline has changed drastically since my last visit, as One World Trade Center now dominates all surrounding builings. In fact, the building was visible 25 minutes before our landing at Newark.</p>

    			<h4>Newark to Rome</h4>

    			<p>After some pizza, we left Newark on a Boeing 767-300 at 5:20 PM (EST). Each seat had its own monitor, so I was able to watch a few episodes of the HBO series <i>Silicon Valley</i>. We were served a dinner of rice and chicken, followed by a breakfast consisting of a croissant and yogurt. Since I was towards the back and in the middle aisle right next to the lavatory, I was not able to get much sleep. We arrived in Rome at 7:10 AM (Central European Time &ndash; CET).
